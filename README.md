Docker workshop
================

What is Docker??
---------------

Docker is an **open-source** project that **automates** the **deployment** of applications inside software **containers**. It has very developed eco-system to make, distribute and handle containers. Also it’s very well documented.

Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as _cgroups_ and kernel _namespaces_, and a _union-capable file system_ such as OverlayFS and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.

Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

Why do we need it?
------------------

* Faster development process (using 3rd parties like PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, whatever)..
* Handy application encapsulation (you can deliver your application in one piece).
* Same behaviour on local machine / dev / stage / production servers.
* Easy and clear monitoring.
* Easy to scale (If you’ve done your application right it will be ready to scaling even not only in Docker).

What is the difference from virtualization?
-------------------------------------------

**Virtual machines** include the application, the necessary binaries and libraries, and an entire guest operating system - all of which can amount to tens of GBs.

**Docker containers** include the application and all of its dependencies - but share the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. Docker containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure: they run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud.

Link: [Docker containers and VMs](https://www.docker.com/what-container#/virtual_machines)

Supported platforms
-------------------

Because Docker is based on features of Linux kernel the only native platform is Linux. But there a lot native applications for other platforms such as MacOS and Windows. For this platforms Docker application is encapsulated into tiny virtual machine with Linux. The usability of this applications now is on very high level. Also there a lot of supplementary apps such as [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) or [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/) which helps to install Docker on platforms different from Linux and operate with it.

Installation

Terminology
-----------

**Container** - running instance with required application. Containers are always created from images. Container could expose ports and  volumes to interact with other containers or outer world. Container could be easily killed / removed and re-created again in a very short time.

Link: [About containers](https://www.docker.com/what-container#/package_software)

**Image** - basic element for every container. Uses copy-on-write model. During building images every step is cached and could be reused. Building images could take some time - it depends on particular image. While containers can be started from images very quickly.

Link: [Dockerfile - best practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/)

**Port** - is a TCP/UDP port in it’s classical meaning. There are a lot of modes for networking in Docker containers, so to make things simpler let’s assume that ports could be exposed to outer world (accessible from host OS) or connected to other containers - accessible only from that containers and invisible from outer world.

**Volume** - the best explanation is shared folder. Volume keeps data outside of its container but accessible from this container or other connected containers. Data stored in volumes is persistent.

Link: [Managing data in Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/)

**Registry** - server that keeps images. Could be compared with git - you can pull image from registry to deploy it locally and you can push locally built images to registry (create new image or update image version on registry). Docker registry application is Open Source app like the main application - so you could deploy your private Docker Registry on any server you want.

Link: [Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/)

**Docker hub** - is a registry with web-interface. It keeps a lot of Docker images with different software. There are “official” Docker images (made by Docker team or in cooperation with original software vendors - don’t assume that it’s always official software vendors). It’s free to register and has payed options. You can have one private image per account and infinite amount of public images for free.

Link: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/)

Preparations
------------

If you're running Docker on Linux you need to run all following commands as `root` or you can add your user to `docker` group and re-login to make changes apply:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker `whoami`
```

If you're running Docker on MacOS you don't need this actions.

Example 1: hello world
----------------------

Let’s run our first container:

```
docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world'
```

Console output:

```
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
d54efb8db41d: Pull complete
f8b845f45a87: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
Hello world
```

* **docker run** is command to run a container.
* **ubuntu** is the image you run, for example the Ubuntu operating system image. When you specify an image, Docker looks first for the image on your Docker host. If the image does not exist locally, then the image is pulled from the public image registry Docker Hub.
* **/bin/echo 'Hello world'** is the command to run inside the new container.

This container just prints `Hello world` and stops its execution. Not very big deal, yeah?. Let’s try to create an interactive shell inside Docker container:

```
docker run -i -t --rm ubuntu /bin/bash
```

* **-t** flag assigns a pseudo-tty or terminal inside the new container.
* **-i** flag allows you to make an interactive connection by grabbing the standard input (STDIN) of the container.
* **--rm** flag to automatically remove the container when it exits. By default containers are not deleted.

This container lives until we keep the shell session and dies when we exit from session (like SSH session to remote server). To keep container running we need to daemonize it:

```
docker run --name daemon -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"
```

* **--name daemon** assign name `daemon` to new container. If you don’t specify a name explicitly Docker will generate it automatically and assign it to the container.
* **-d** flag runs the container in the background (daemonize it).

Let’s see what containers do we have now:

```
docker ps -a
```

Console output:

```
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE   COMMAND                 CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS  NAMES
1fc8cee64ec2  ubuntu  "/bin/sh -c 'while..."  32 seconds ago      Up 30 seconds                         daemon
c006f1a02edf  ubuntu  "/bin/echo 'Hello ..."  About a minute ago  Exited (0) About a minute ago         gifted_nobel
```

* **docker ps** is command to command to list containers.
* **-a** show all containers (default shows only running).

Command shows us that we have two containers:
* `gifted_nobel` (name for this container was generated automatically - it will be different on your machine) - it's the first container we've created which printed 'Hello world' once.
* `daemon` - it's the third container we've created which runs as a daemon.

Also there is no second container with interactive shell because we’ve set `--rm` option and it was automatically deleted after execution.

Ok. Let’s see what daemon container is doing right - let’s see the logs of it:

```
docker logs -f daemon
```

Console output:

```
...
hello world
hello world
hello world
```

* **docker logs** is command to fetch the logs of a container.
* **-f** flag to follow the log output (works actually like `tail -f`).

Now let’s stop `daemon` container:

```
docker stop daemon
```

* **docker stop** is command to stop Docker container.

```
docker ps -a
```

Console output:

```
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE   COMMAND                 CREATED        STATUS                      PORTS  NAMES
1fc8cee64ec2  ubuntu  "/bin/sh -c 'while..."  5 minutes ago  Exited (137) 5 seconds ago         daemon
c006f1a02edf  ubuntu  "/bin/echo 'Hello ..."  6 minutes ago  Exited (0) 6 minutes ago           gifted_nobel
```

Now container `daemon` is stopped. We can start it again:

```
docker start daemon
```

And ensure that it’s running:

```
docker ps -a
```

Console output:

```
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE   COMMAND                 CREATED        STATUS                    PORTS  NAMES
1fc8cee64ec2  ubuntu  "/bin/sh -c 'while..."  5 minutes ago  Up 3 seconds                     daemon
c006f1a02edf  ubuntu  "/bin/echo 'Hello ..."  6 minutes ago  Exited (0) 7 minutes ago         gifted_nobel
```

Now let’s stop it again and remove all the containers manually:

```
docker stop daemon
docker rm <your first container name>
docker rm daemon
```

To remove all containers we can use this command:

```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

* **docker rm** is command to remove container.
* **-f** flag (for `rm`) is to stop container if it's running (force deletion).
* **-q** flag (for `ps`) is to print only container IDs.

Let's run `ps` again to ensure that we don't have containers:

```
docker ps -a
```

Console output:

```
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE    COMMAND    CREATED    STATUS    PORTS    NAMES
```

Example 2: nginx
----------------

Now let’s try to create and run more meaningful container like `nginx`.

```
cd examples/nginx
docker run -d --name test-nginx -p 80:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html:ro nginx:latest
```

Console output:

```
Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/nginx

6decb850d2bc: Pull complete
c3e19f087ed6: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:52a189e49c0c797cfc5cbfe578c68c225d160fb13a42954144b29af3fe4fe335
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
436a602273b0ca687c61cc843ab28163c720a1810b09005a36ea06f005b0c971
```

* **-p** is a ports mapping `<HOST PORT>:<CONTAINER PORT>`.
* **-v** is a volume mounting `<HOST DIRECTORY>:<CONTAINER DIRECTORY>`.

**Important**: `run` command accepts only absolute paths. In our example we've used `$(pwd)` to set current directory absolute path.

Now you can check [this url](http://127.0.0.1/) url in your browser.

We can try to change `/example/nginx/index.html` (which is mounted as a volume to directory `/usr/share/nginx/html` inside container) and refresh the page.

Let’s investigate some information about `test-nginx` container:

```
docker inspect test-nginx
```

This command displays system wide information regarding the Docker installation. Information displayed includes the kernel version, number of containers and images, exposed ports, mounted volumes, etc.

There are a lot of information in `inspect` output. If we just need to see the port mappings we can use `port`:

```
docker port test-nginx
```

Console output:

```
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:80
```

Dockerfile
----------

To build a Docker image you need to write Dockerfile. It’s a plain text file with instructions and its arguments. Here is the description of instructions we’ll use in next example:

* **FROM** - set base image
* **RUN** - execute command in container
* **ENV** - set environment variable
* **WORKDIR** - set working directory
* **VOLUME** - create mount-point for volume
* **CMD** - set executable for container

Link: [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

Example 3: writing Dockerfile
-----------------------------

Let’s create an image that will get site contents with `curl` and store it to the text file. We’ll pass site url via environment variable `SITE_URL`. Resulting file will be placed in a directory mounted as volume. Here is our [Dockerfile](examples/curl/Dockerfile):

```
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y curl
ENV SITE_URL https://google.com/
WORKDIR /data
VOLUME /data
CMD sh -c "curl -L $SITE_URL > /data/results"
```

Step into `examples/curl` directory and execute the following command to build an image:

```
docker build . -t test-curl
```

Console output:

```

 ---> 5ebb2a65d771

Successfully built 5ebb2a65d771
```

* **docker build** is a command to build a new image locally.
* **-t** set the name:tag to image.

Now we have our new image and we can see it in list of existing images:

```
docker images
```

Console output:

```
REPOSITORY  TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
test-curl   latest  5ebb2a65d771  37 minutes ago  180 MB
nginx       latest  6b914bbcb89e  7 days ago      182 MB
ubuntu      latest  0ef2e08ed3fa  8 days ago      130 MB
```

So we can create and run container from image. Let’s try with default parameters:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/vol:/data/:rw test-curl
```

Console output:

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   263  100   263    0     0   1568      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  1574
100 11607    0 11607    0     0  27104      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 27104
```

To see results saved to file run `cat ./vol/results`.

Let’s try with `facebook.com`:

```
docker run --rm -e SITE_URL=https://facebook.com/ -v $(pwd)/vol:/data/:rw test-curl
```

Console output:

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
100  116k    0  116k    0     0   168k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  820k
```

Again to see results run `cat ./vol/results`.

Difference between images & containers
--------------------------------------

**Containers** are the running instances based on images.

**Images** are the sequence of instructions (layers) from Dockerfile and base image context.

| mode | Command | Layer |  |
|-------|---------------------|-------|---|
| **write** | **container goes here** | 2b064135b7f0 |  |
| read only | CMD sh -c "curl -L $SITE_URL > /data/results" | 5ebb2a65d771 | ⬆ |
| read only | VOLUME /data | 6802707a7114 | ⬆ |
| read only | WORKDIR /data | c024301ddfb8 | ⬆ |
| read only | ENV SITE_URL `https://google.com/` | 9a733ee39a46 | ⬆ |
| read only | RUN apt-get install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y curl | f3c6d26b95e6 | ⬆ |
| read only | RUN apt-get update | 35ac5017c794 | ⬆ |
| **read only** | **base image** | 0ef2e08ed3fa | ⬆ |

Best practices of creating images
---------------------------------

* Include only necessary context - use `.dockerignore` file (it works like `.gitignore` in git).
* Avoid installing unnecessary packages - it will consume extra disk space.
* Use cache. Add context which changes a lot (for example source code of your project) at the end of Dockerfile - it will utilize Docker cache effectively.
* Be careful with volumes. You should remember what data is in volumes. Because volumes are persistent and don’t die with the containers - next container will use data from volume which was created by previous container.
* Use environment variables (in `RUN`, `EXPOSE`, `VOLUME`). It will make your Dockerfile more flexible.

Link: [Dockerfile - best practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/)

Connection between containers
-----------------------------

**Docker compose** - is the only right way to connect containers with each other.

You can setup connection between containers in a simple declarative manner by writing [YAML config file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/).

In case of Linux you need to install compose separately - you can do it with `pip`:

```
pip install docker-compose
```

Link: [Docker compose - overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)

Example 4: docker-compose Python + Redis
----------------------------------------

Step into directory `examples/compose` and execute the following command:

```
docker-compose --project-name app-test -f docker-compose.yml up
```

Console output:

```

Current example will increment view counter in Redis. Open [this url](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser to check it.

Using `docker-compose` is a topic for separate workshop. To get started you can play with some images from Docker Hub or if you want to create your own images - follow best practices listed above. The only thing I can add in terms of using docker-compose: **always give explicit names to your volumes** in docker-compose.yml (if image has volumes). This simple rule will save you from issue in the future when you'll be inspecting your volumes.

```
version: '2'
services:
  ...
  redis:
    image: redis:3.2-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
volumes:
  redis_data:
```

In this case `redis_data` will be the name inside docker-compose.yml file, for the real volume name it will be prepended with project name prefix.

To see volumes run:

```
docker volume ls
```

Console output:

```
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               apptest_redis_data
```

Without explicit volume name there will be UUID. And here is an example from my local machine:

```

Docker way
----------

Docker has some restrictions and requirements for the architecture of your system (applications that you pack into containers). You can ignore this requirements or find some workarounds to break this restrictions, but this actions won't let you fully get the profit from using Docker. My strong advice is to follow this statements:

* 1 application = 1 container
* Run process in foreground inside containers (don't use systemd, upstart or any other similar tools)
* Keep data out of container (use volumes)
* No SSH (if you need to step into container you can use [exec](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) command)
* No manual configurations (or actions) inside container
